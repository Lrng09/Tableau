## Insights
### <ins>Overall Rating Trends Over Time</ins>	
* __Stability and Volatility:__ The average overall rating has remained stable over the years, ranging between 4 and 6. However, there are noticeable dips in 2020 and 2021, likely due to the pandemic’s impact on service quality and operations.
* __Recent Performance:__ Ratings in the latter half of 2023 show a downward trend, indicating potential recent dissatisfaction that require immediate attention.

### <ins>Service Category Performance</ins>
* __Cabin Staff Service (Avg: 3.3):__ This is one of the stronger performing metrics, suggesting staff professionalism and interaction generally meet expectations.

* __Seat Comfort (Avg: 2.9) and Ground Service (Avg: 3.0):__ These metrics are close to average, showing moderate satisfaction but room for improvement.

* __Food & Beverages (Avg: 2.4):__ This lower score indicates that onboard dining is not meeting passenger expectations and could benefit from upgrades in quality, variety, or presentation.

* __Entertainment (Avg: 1.4):__ This is the weakest performing metric. It suggests a major gap in customer experience, possibly due to outdated systems, limited content, or technical issues. Improving this area could greatly boost overall satisfaction.

* __Value for Money (Avg: 2.8):__ This shows that customers are moderately satisfied with what they receive for the price, but it doesn’t reflect strong perceived value.

* Promote the availability of entertainment features during booking and boarding to boost perception and usage.
### Improve Food & Beverage Offerings
